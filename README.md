# Exploiting virtual networks for security training
This work illustrates how to perform various types of security attacks since, in order to be able
to defend from something, it is necessary to understand how it works, together with mechanisms
to prevent them. The exercises will be reproduced on the **Mininet** virtual environment so that no real
harm can be done and various configurations can be used and explained step by step.
There is no mandatory knowledge required to follow this work, since all the attacks, defence
mechanisms, commands and tools illustrated are explained, but basic knowledge of Linux systems,
networking and cybersecurity in general, would help to grasp the concepts better and
faster.

The *report.pdf* file contains the full manual together with information about the importance of cybersecurity and a brief analysis of virtual environments.
